# Customer Behavior Data Analyst Portfolio Project

This project represents a complete, industry standard, end-to-end data analytics workflow, designed to mirror the real responsibilities of professional analysts in modern business environments. The project encompasses all critical stages of data analysis, from data preparation and modeling to insight generation, visualization and reporting.


## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

 1. Data Preparation, Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

 2. Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty and purchase drivers.

 3. Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Business Problem

Many retail businesses do not clearly understand how their customers behave, such as which age groups purchase more, what products are popular and how often customers shop. Without this information, it becomes difficult to improve customer experience and increase revenue. This project analyzes customer shopping data to help businesses better understand customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

## Objectives

- Understand customer purchasing behavior  
- Analyze customer activity across different age groups  
- Identify popular product categories and items  
- Study spending patterns and purchase frequency  
- Provide simple insights that can help businesses make better decisions
- 
## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is a customer shopping behavior dataset collected from an online source. It contains **3,900 records** and includes information such as customer age, gender, location, items purchased, purchase amount, payment method, subscription status, and purchase frequency. This dataset is used to analyze how customers shop and how different factors affect purchasing behavior.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas and NumPy for data analysis  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
- Power BI for dashboard creation  
- GitHub for version control  

## Project Workflow

1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis  
3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. Analyzed customer behavior by age, gender, and category  
5. Studied purchase amount and purchase frequency  
6. Created visualizations and a Power BI dashboard  
7. Summarized key findings and insights  

## Key Analysis

- Customer distribution by age and gender  
- Analysis of popular product categories and items  
- Purchase amount analysis across different customer groups  
- Study of payment methods and purchase frequency  
- Review of subscription status and previous purchases  

## Key Insights

- Certain age groups shop more frequently than others  
- Clothing and footwear are among the most purchased categories  
- Customers with subscriptions tend to purchase more often  
- Digital payment methods are commonly used by customers  

## Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize customer behavior and shopping trends. The dashboard shows customer distribution, purchase amounts, popular categories and purchase frequency, making it easier to understand customer patterns at a glance.

## Future Improvements

- Add more recent or real-time customer data  
- Perform advanced customer segmentation  
- Use machine learning models to predict customer behavior  
- Improve the dashboard with more interactive features
